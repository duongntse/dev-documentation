1. sign up TravisCI
      https://travis-ci.org/
2. Once you're signed up, click on the + button and find your repository
3. click on the big 'activate repo' button.
4. To allow Travis CI to automatically log in Surge for us during deployment
     we need to add SURGE_LOGIN and SURGE_TOKEN environment variables
          a. Open "More Options"
          b. Click "settings"
                  Create variables:
                           SURGE_LOGIN: duongntse@gmail.com
                           SURGE_TOKEN: "type [surge token] to get the token in your terminal"
                                   (note: and also run npm i surge -D)
5. touch .travis.yml: 
```
        language: node_js
        node_js:
            - '12.13.0'
        before_deploy:
            - 'CI=false npm run build'
        deploy:
            provider: script
            skip_cleanup: true
            script: sh scripts/deploy.sh
            on:
